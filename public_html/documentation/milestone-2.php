		<p>Document - in detail - the content you plan to feature in each section of your site. Be sure to include any details regarding interactive features and functionality that you wish to include. You are not expected to have any actual content prepared at this time, rather only a plan for the kind of content you would like to feature.</p>
		<p>Keep this section brief and succinct, yet detailed enough to guide your development phase. One paragraph per content section should be sufficient.</p>

		<!--Content Strategy-->
      <h3>Content Strategy</h3>
      <p><strong>Nav Menu</strong>: The navigation menu will contain five sections/anchors on the same static page: Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact. For the mobile version, the navigation will be collapsed by default, in the top right corner, and will expand downward when selected. On the desktop version, it will be displayed inline-block and aligned to the right.</p>
      <p><strong>Header</strong>: The header will be simple and succinct, stating only my name-brand in large characters. When user navigates downward, the header will shrink to fill only the top left corner of the page. Navigation links will be anchored to various points further down the page, and the links will have hover effects (desktop version). Directly below the header are links to my pages/profiles such as LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>About Me</strong>: The about-me section of the page will contain a brief description of my professional skills and purpose/mission, and what I wish to add to the Central NM community.</p>
      <p><strong>Services</strong>: Because I plan to freelance at a minimum, I would like to advertise the services that I am available for. These will include UI/UX design, Full-stack Web Development, and Consulting. Each of these services will have a brief description so that prospective clients will have a clear picture of what's offered.</p>
      <p><strong>Portfolio</strong>: Portfolio section will be fairly straightforward, with a snapshot of past projects I've worked on. At this point, there aren't very many, so I will be featuring my Bootstrap challenge, NM-Outdoors, and a passion project to be determined. Below the snapshot will be a brief paragraph describing the purpose of the site. The snapshots will be hyperlinked to the actual site so that visitors can browse for themselves.</p>
      <p><strong>Contact</strong>: There will be a simple contact form to allow users to contact me directly from the page to express interest in my services. This will include input areas for Name, Email, Text, and will also have a Captcha requirement prior to sending.</p>
      <p><strong>Footer</strong>: The footer will be nothing fancy, but will have my brand - HalfMortise - centered at the bottom of the page with a copyright. Directly above the footer will be more links to the same external profiles/pages.</p>
