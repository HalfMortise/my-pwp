		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<div>
			<img class="img" src="./images/hr.jpg" width="200px">
			<ul>Name: Laura Groves</ul>
			<ul>Gender: Female</ul>
			<ul>Age: 38</ul>
			<ul>Profession: Hiring manager at software engineering firm</ul>
		</div>
		<p>User Story: Laura wants to see a portfolio (personal website) to verify technical skills.</p>
		<p>Attitude: Laura is very active online. She knows that she needs to be not only aware of candidates' online presence but also conducts a great amount of research</p>
		<p>Likes: A well-put together site with substantial content that reflects good written communication skills as well as programming language skills.</p>
		<p>Needs: Laura is a web-savvy user but without technical expertise, and who expects ease of access and use.  She doesn't care about the code on the back end, but would be happy to recommend the site to others if it provides a positive user experience.</p>
		<p>Frustrations: The limitations of LinkedIn, being able to verify a candidate's technical skills.<br/>The pressure to hire a qualified candidate without sufficient information to review.</p>
		<p>Technology comfort level : high</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Very comfortable with newest technology and able to browse websites with ease and efficiency.</li>
			<li>Always gets the newest version iPhone: X iOS 11.x  (the company also provides her with a company iPhone).</li>
			<li>At work, she uses a Dell XPS 13, which has the 8th Gen i7, Intel UHD Graphics 620, 16 GB RAM, 13.3" screen, and 1TB SSD storage.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Use Case: When Laura is hiring new software developers, she reviews resumes and LinkedIn profiles, but she also regularly searches the web for candidates' additional online presence. Her project managers have let her know to be on the look-out for GitHub activity and websites that the candidates may have already authored, to include a personal website. To them, this reflects intiative, confidence in and a willingess to market one's skills, and full immersion into the industry.</p>

			<p>Document - in detail - the content you plan to feature in each section of your site. Be sure to include any details regarding interactive features and functionality that you wish to include. You are not expected to have any actual content prepared at this time, rather only a plan for the kind of content you would like to feature.</p>
			<p>Keep this section brief and succinct, yet detailed enough to guide your development phase. One paragraph per content section should be sufficient.</p>
