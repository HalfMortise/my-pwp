DDC Assignment: Personal website project will be completed in 3 phases, and content will be professional in nature.

# Milestone1  
## Specifications
Unfortunately, you have over complicated the layout of the persona, purpose, audience, and goal. I wanted you to combine all the content into a single file called Milestone1.php. Instead, you separated out the persona from the purpose, audience, and goal. With that mistake in mind, all other project specifications have been met.
## Site Feedback
What you hope to accomplish with your PWP should be straight foreword and relatively easy to achieve. With your emphasis on highlighting your social media presence and resume make sure all relevant links stand out and are easy to find.
### Grade Tier III  
# Milestone 2a
## Overall Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone2a. Directory structure, Html, Git history, and content are superb. This is the quality of work I would expect out of a jr developer working underneath me. The road map you laid out for yourself in Milestone2a will be extremely beneficial when you start development.
### Wireframes
Your Wireframes are beautiful and easy to understand. With a quick glance I am able to tell what you hope to accomplish and have a clear vision of what your website will look like. The Mobile and Desktop wireframes match and are clearly of the same site(which should translate nicely bootstrap4).
### Content Strategy 
Your content strategy is extensive and to the point, and complements your wireframes perfectly. 
## Design Tips
Because your site is not over relying on interactivity I challenge you to make your website as clean and polished as possible with solid a color scheme and typography. (remember simple/clean is harder to accomplish than overly-complicated/bloated)

## Moving Foreword
We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Please use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory from here out!
